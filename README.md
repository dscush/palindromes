# Palindromes #

## Description ##

This was my solution for a job test.  The idea was to find the lowest base in which a number is a palindrome, and find that base for each of the first 1000 positive integers

## Installation ##

1. `git clone https://github.com/dscush/palindromes.git`
2. `cd palindromes`
3. `python3 find_1000_palindromes.py`
4. Look at the `output.csv` file.

It also happens to be compatible with Python 2, but that's purely coincidental.  ([The end is near!](http://www.pythonclock.org))
